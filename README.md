<h1>University Project - MERN Stack Photovoltaic System</h1>

This project is developed as part of my DWT (Database and Web Techniques) subject project at Technische Universit√§t Chemnitz. The Photovoltaic System is a full-stack application built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It allows users to monitor and analyze photovoltaic data, visualize system performance, and generate reports.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>User-friendly interface for managing projects, products, and PV details</li>
<li>Real-time data collection and visualization of photovoltaic system parameters</li>
<li>Report generation with a graphical representation of system performance</li>
<li>Secure password storage using encryption techniques</li>
<li>Dynamic rendering to support various device screens, including mobile phones, tablets, and laptops</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Every project file, including the database setup file, is present in this project.</li>
  <li>Install the dependencies. Run <strong>npm install</strong> inside the root directory and /server directory.</li>
  <li>Finally, use the command <strong>npm start</strong> inside the root directory to run the app! Both frontend and backend will run parallely.</li>
</ul>
