<bold>University Project - MERN Stack Photovoltaic System<bold>

This project is developed as part of my DWT (Database and Web Techniques) subject project at [University Name]. The Photovoltaic System is a full-stack application built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It allows users to monitor and analyze photovoltaic data, visualize system performance, and generate reports.

Features
User-friendly interface for managing projects, products, and PV details
Real-time data collection and visualization of photovoltaic system parameters
Report generation with graphical representation of system performance
Secure password storage using encryption techniques
Dynamic rendering to support various device screens, including mobile phones, tablets, and laptops

Getting Started:
